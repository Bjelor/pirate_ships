# Pirate ships

A sample project meant as a presentation of my coding skills for job interviews.

Shows a list of pirate ships downloaded via REST and then stored locally. Tapping on an item opens a detail of the item. Floating action button shows an alert dialog with a greeting corresponding to its pirate ship.

Support for tablets is limited but... "is".
